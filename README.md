Apart from merely viewing charts, users will be able to hide unnecessary parameters or items and later get them back, if needed. Chart will also highlight parameters with the same values and best/worst items with selected parameters.

Row elements include: a check box, text (both can include a description that will be hidden by default and shown on a click), and delimiter that will allow you to group several options compared to others (its description is also hidden until you click its name link).

Once they are done with the selection, they can go ahead to enjoy all the features of the abovementioned ready-made charts.
